# PV_auxillary
A study on the effects of auxillary data on the performance of an LSTM solar PV forecasting model

## Datasets
1. openclimatefix/uk_pv [href=https://huggingface.co/datasets/openclimatefix/uk_pv] dataset was usead as the primary dataset of photovoltaic power generation
2. ERA5 [https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview] dataset was used as the source of the meteorological data, namely total cloud cover, skin temperature, and surface solar radiation
